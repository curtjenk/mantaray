# Mantaray

Manatary is an humitartian effort to save the manatarays using social media.

The app has the following features
* Registration
* Login
* The logged in user can up/down vote a post only once.  This rule is enforced with a database constraint
* Follow/Unfollow other supporters
* Make donation.
  * Users who make a donation get to see a video

### Tech

* [AngularJS] - MVC framework
* [Bootstrap] - layout, etc.
* [Angular-UI-Bootstrap] - image carousel
* [Angular Messages] - form validation
* [Apache] - webserver
* [jQuery] - JavaScript library
* [MySQL] - relational database
* [MeekroDB] - PHP MySQL library
* [Font Awesome] - Icons
